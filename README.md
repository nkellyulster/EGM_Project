# üéØ Aim
This study uses the Python programming language to apply Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis to Northern Ireland (NI) primary school level enrolment data. The primary aim of the analysis is to produce evidence-based analysis of the distance between each of the 787 primary schools in NI and their closest school, based on differing management types. This study examines the sustainability of all primary schools, investigating the potential for designating a number of small schools as being Strategically Important Small Schools (SISS).

# üìñ Background
According to [NI school enrolment data published by the NI Department of Education](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/publications/school-enrolment-school-level-data-202223) there are 787 primary schools in Northern Ireland for the academic year 2023/24. 

The Department is responsible for managing the school estate and planning, on an area basis, for the future provision of schools. This entire process is part of their objective to "ensure that all children get a first class education in fit for purpose facilities, regardless of background or where they live." The Department of Education‚Äôs policy document [‚ÄòSchools for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools‚Äô](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/publications/schools-future-policy-sustainable-schools), outlines six criteria that provide a framework for considering issues of school sustainability. This document stems from the [2006 Independent Strategic Review of Education](https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/9777/1/review_of_education.pdf), more commonly known as the Bain Report.

The policy sets out six criteria to be considered in assessing a school's educational viability, as follows:-

* quality educational experience
* stable enrolment trends
* sound financial position
* strong leadership and management
* accessibility
* strong links with the community

In reality, the key determinant of a school's sustainability is its enrolment. In an urban area the enrolment threshold for a sustainable school is 140 pupils, and in a rural area it is 105 pupils. According to the Department's own criteria, in 2023/24 there are 210 schools (27% of the total primary schools) which are ‚Äònot sustainable‚Äô based on enrolment.

Every year the management authority of schools work together with the Education Authority and Department of Education to determine which primary schools which are deemed as unsustainable should be considered for closure. The process that feeds into this involves the publication of a Case for Change from the management authority and this can lead to the creation of a Development Proposal which can ultimately lead to the Minister of Education making a decision on whether or not a school should close. Since 2009/10 over 60 small, mostly rural primary schools have been closed, having been deemed unsustainable.

For a number of years, there has been a growing sense that the Sustainable Schools Policy has been a blunt instrument used as the justification for the closing of small, rural schools, and that criteria should be used to identify small schools which are strategically important. This would not mean that these schools would be exempt from the consideration of the Sustainable Schools Policy but that their relative remoteness would be taken into consideration when schools were being assessed under the policy.

In December 2023, the long-awaited *Independent Review of Education* was [published](https://www.independentreviewofeducation.org.uk/). The Review is an outworking of the New Decade, New Approach deal, which stated ‚Äúthe education system has a diversity of school types, each with its own distinctive ethos and values. However, it is not sustainable. The parties acknowledge the progress made in developing new models of sharing, cooperation and integration. There is a desire to build on this as a basis for delivering long-term improvements in the quality, equity and sustainability of the system. The parties agree that the Executive will commission and oversee an independent fundamental review with a focus on quality and sustainability.‚Äù

# üè´ Strategically Important Small Schools
The idea of designating some schools as being strategically important has been discussed for a number of years but there has been no actual progress on how to determine what constitutes a strategically important small school. And that is the issue which this project aims to address.

![Strategically Important Small Schools Roadmap](https://github.com/nkellyulster/Strategically-Important-Small-Schools/blob/main/Images/Tyrone%20Constitution.jpg)
*Caption: Tyrone Constitution - Thursday 25 April 2024 - "Greater recognition needed for strategically important small schools"*

Using GIS analysis of the distance between schools and looking at the distances between different management types a number of schools have been designated as being strategically important small schools as there is a considerable distance between them and the nearest school in the same management type. The outputs of this project can be examined in more detail, but produce very clear recommendations on a small number of schools which, if they were closed on the grounds of 'sustainability' would have a negative impact on their local areas. Due to the nature of this analysis, and the methodology adopted, these schools are typically schools from the minority community in an area that has schools for the other main management type, which is why the designation of these schools as being important takes on a more strategic approach.

# üôã Audience
Anyone with an interest in primary school education in Northern Ireland or anyone with a general interest in the role small schools play across the education system. This project should be of interest to both policy-makers and decision-makers within the Department of Education, the Educathion Authority, as well as management authorities who are involved in making strategic decisions about the future of primary education in Northern Ireland.

Should you wish to manually load the data from the original sources you can do this.

NI primary school enrolment data is updated on an annual basis by the NI Department of Education. The [school enrolments page](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/school-enrolments) contains a plethora of information and datasets. School level enrolment data from 2009/10 - 2023/24 is available on the [School enrolments - school level data page](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-enrolments-school-level-data). The most recent dataset, for 2023/24 was published on 19 March 2024 and the [datatset used in this project is available as an XLSX file](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX).

Links are provided in the code so that enrolment data from every year since 2009/10 can be analsysed.

# üéõÔ∏è Troubleshooting
There are limited things that can go wrong with this code, which means there are probably more things that can go wrong with the code than I am willing to admit.

All of the input files are read directly from the GitHub repository and guidance is provided above on how to manually read in data.

This means the only other problem that could realistically exist is that your version of Python is too old or you have not read in the required Python libraries.

If your version of Python is too old, you should get the most recent version of Python that is available. This code was written using `version 3.12` so I would suggest using `version 3.12.`

If you have not installed the required libraries I would recommend installing the required libraries. A list of all the required external modules is provided at the very top of the [Strategically Important Small Schools.py script](https://github.com/nkellyulster/Strategically-Important-Small-Schools/blob/main/Strategically_Important_Small_Schools.py) and in the [environment file](https://github.com/nkellyulster/Strategically-Important-Small-Schools/blob/main/environment.yml).

Functionality has been provided which allows for historic data to be read in from the [Department of Education's School enrolments - school level data website](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-enrolments-school-level-data). This website contains primary school enrolment data as far back as 2009/10. This allows users to compare the various outputs from the current year against data at any point from 2009/2010. There is a comment in the script to explain how to do this as well as as advisory note to say that the data structure differs from year to year so care should be taken to ensure that the `all_schools` dataframe generates correctly. Should the `all_schools` dataframe not generate as a result of missing columns or column with different names you should consult the console to determine what the error is.

For example, the error `KeyError: "['DE ref'] not found in axis"` indicates that the column `DE ref` is not found and when you look closer at the input file you can see that in this file the relevant column is called `De ref` so the code will need to be amended to read the data in correctly.
