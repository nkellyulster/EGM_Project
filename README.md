# Strategically Important Small Schools v1.0

## üì∞ Aim
The aim of the Strategically Important Small Schools (SISS) project is to look at the number of primary schools in Northern Ireland and identify which small schools are strategically important, based on their location, enrolment, and management type.

## üôã Audience
Anyone with an interest in primary school education in Northern Ireland or anyone with a general interest in the role small schools play across the education system. This project should be of interest to decision-makers within the Department of Education as well as management authorities who are involved in making strategic decisions about the future of primary education in Northern Ireland.

NI primary school enrolment data is updated on an annual basis by the NI Department of Education. The [school enrolments page](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/school-enrolments) contains a plethora of information and datasets. School level enrolment data from 2009/10 - 2023/24 is available on the [School enrolments - school level data page](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-enrolments-school-level-data). The most recent dataset, for 2023/24 was published on 19 March 2024 and the [datatset used in this project is available as an XLSX file](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX).

### üì§ Manual Installation
To load the 2023/24 dataset and read in the reference data sheet run the following Python script:
```ruby
schools = pd.read_excel("https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX",
sheet_name = "reference data",
skiprows = 3)
```

Equally, to load the 2023/24 dataset and read in the enrolment data sheet run the following Python script:
```ruby
enrolment = pd.read_excel("https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX",
sheet_name = "total enrolment",
skiprows = 3)
```

The locational data comes from the Doogal website and is already saved in GitHub as the `BT_postcodes.csv` file. Should you wish to manually read the spreadsheet you first need to download the file from the [BT postcodes Northern Ireland page](https://www.doogal.co.uk/UKPostcodes?Search=BT). Click on the Download button and select "Data for this area as CSV (for Excel etc)". This will download the CSV file to your machine. Simply insert the file path in the code chuck below to read it into Pyth:
```ruby
bt_postcodes = pd.read_csv(<you_file_path.csv>)
```

## üèÉ Running the code
Running the code is a fairly straightforward process.

The code can be run in small chunks to produce some of the outputs or can be run in its entirety to produce all outputs.

### üêç Outputs
In terms of outputs, the code produces a number of dataframes, csv outputs, html interactive maps and charts.

This code produces the following outputs: 
*  `rows_not_in_bt_postcodes` a dataframe with all the school postcodes which do not appear in the `bt_postcodes` dataframe
*  `school_count` a simple count of the number of primary schools in Northern Ireland

*  `Map: Strategically Important Small Schools with boundaries` this is the same as `Map: Strategically Important Small Schools` only this has the parliamentary boundaries layer added

## üìñ Background
According to NI school enrolment data there are 787 primary schools in Northern Ireland. 

The Department of Education‚Äôs policy document [‚ÄòSchools for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools‚Äô](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/publications/schools-future-policy-sustainable-schools), outlines six criteria that provide a framework for considering issues of school sustainability. This document stems from the [2006 Independent Strategic Review of Education](https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/9777/1/review_of_education.pdf), more commonly known as the Bain Report.

In reality, the key determinant of a school's sustainability is it‚Äôs enrolment. In an urban area the enrolment threshold for a sustainable school is 140 pupils, and in a rural area it is 105 pupils. According to the Department's own criteria, in 2023/24 there are 210 schools (27% of the total primary schools) which are ‚Äònot sustainable‚Äô based on enrolment.

## üéõÔ∏è Troubleshooting
There are limited things that can go wrong with this code, which means there are probably more things that can go wrong with the code than I am willing to admit.

All of the input files are read directly from the GitHub repository and guidance is provided above on how to manually read in data.

This means the only other problem that could realistically exist is that your version of Python is too old or you have not read in the required Python libraries.

If your version of Python is too old, you should get the most recent version of Python that is available. This code was written using version 3.12 so I would suggest using `version 3.12.`

If you have not installed the required libraries I would recommend installing the required libraries. A list of all the required libraries is contained at the very top of the [SISS.py script](https://github.com/nkellyulster/Strategically-Important-Small-Schools/blob/main/SISS.py) or in the [environment file](https://github.com/nkellyulster/Strategically-Important-Small-Schools/blob/main/environment.yml).

Functionality has been provided which allows for historic data to be read in from the [Department of Education's School enrolments - school level data website](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-enrolments-school-level-data). This website contains primary school enrolment data as far back as 2009/10. This allows users to compare the various outputs from the current year against data at any point from 2009/2010. There is a comment in the script to explain how to do this as well as as advisory note to say that the data structure differs from year to year so care should be taken to ensure that the `all_schools` dataframe generates correctly. Should the `all_schools` dataframe not generate as a result of missing columns or column with different names you should consuly the console to determine what the error is.

For example, the error `KeyError: "['DE ref'] not found in axis"` indicates that the column `DE ref` is not found and when you look closer at the input file you can see that in this file the releavnt column is called `De ref` so the code will need to be amended to read the data in correctly.
