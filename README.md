## 👍 What the SISS is

## 📖 Background
According to NI school enrolment data there are XXX primary schools in Northern Ireland. The Department of Education’s policy document ‘Schools for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools’, outlines six criteria which provide a framework for considering issues of school sustainability. In reality, the key determinant of a school's sustainability is it’s enrolment. In an urban area the enrolment threshold for a sustainable school is 140 pupils, and in a rural area it is 105 pupils. According to the Department's own threshold, in 2023/24 there are XXX schools (XX% of the total primary schools) which are ‘not sustainable’ based on enrolment.
