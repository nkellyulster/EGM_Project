NI primary school enrolment data is updated on an annual basis by the NI Department of Education. The [school enrolments page](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/school-enrolments) contains a plethora of information and datasets. School level enrolment data from 2009/10 - 2023/24 is available on the [School enrolments - school level data page](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-enrolments-school-level-data). The most recent dataset, for 2023/24 was published on 19 March 2024 and the [datatset used in this project is available as an XLSX file](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX).

### ðŸ“¤ Manual Installation
To load the 2023/24 dataset and read in the reference data sheet run the following Python script:
```ruby
schools = pd.read_excel("https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX",
sheet_name = "reference data",
skiprows = 3)
```

Equally, to load the 2023/24 dataset and read in the enrolment data sheet run the following Python script:
```ruby
enrolment = pd.read_excel("https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/School%20level%20-%20pre-school%20data%20-%20202324.XLSX",
sheet_name = "total enrolment",
skiprows = 3)
```

The locational data comes from the Doogal website and is already saved in GitHub as the BT_postcodes.csv file. Should you wish to manually read the spreadsheet you first need to download the file from the [BT postcodes Northern Ireland page](https://www.doogal.co.uk/UKPostcodes?Search=BT). Click on the Download button and select "Data for this area as CSV (for Excel etc)". This will download the CSV file to your machine. Simply insert the file path in the code chuck below to read it into Pyth:
```ruby
bt_postcodes = pd.read_csv(<you_file_path.csv>)
```

## ðŸ“– Background
According to NI school enrolment data there are XXX primary schools in Northern Ireland. The Department of Educationâ€™s policy document â€˜Schools for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schoolsâ€™, outlines six criteria which provide a framework for considering issues of school sustainability. In reality, the key determinant of a school's sustainability is itâ€™s enrolment. In an urban area the enrolment threshold for a sustainable school is 140 pupils, and in a rural area it is 105 pupils. According to the Department's own threshold, in 2023/24 there are XXX schools (XX% of the total primary schools) which are â€˜not sustainableâ€™ based on enrolment.
